# Game project for postgraduate at FH Campus Wien

## Used Hardware
- Arduino Uno rev3- Microcontroller
- MPU 9250/6500 - IMU Sensor
- USB connector
- 4 Wires

## Programming IDEs
- Processing https://processing.org/
- Arudino https://www.arduino.cc/

## About
This is a game where you control squaty your fitnesspal and "jump" over Obstacles. Place your IMU Sensor on your upper thigh and squat over anything the game throws at you.

## Installation
- Connect your Arduino Board to your Computer or Laptop
- Connect your IMU Sensor to the Microcontroller like so:

- Start up the Arduino IDE, open the Arduino sketch and upload your code
- After uploading close it (!important if Serial port is used Processing code cannot function properly)
- Start up the Processing IDe and start the program
- Have Fun!
